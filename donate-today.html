        <h1>Our Donate Plan</h1>
        <p>
            In the aftermath of the Highland Park, IL shootings on July 4, the North Shore community rallied to help a
            boy who we knew nothing about. We took him to safety under tragic circumstances, came together to locate his
            grandparents, and prayed for the safety of his family.
